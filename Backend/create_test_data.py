            Dr. Smith: Let me take a look. I can see the fracture line on your upper right first molar. The good news is that the root looks healthy. We'll need to do a crown to restore this tooth properly.
            
            Patient: How long will that take?
            
            Dr. Smith: We can do it in two visits. Today we'll prepare the tooth and take impressions, then in two weeks you'll come back for the permanent crown placement.
