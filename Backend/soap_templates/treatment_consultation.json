Use \"Dr -\" and \"Pt -\" format to show who is speaking.\n\nSTRUCTURE:\n1. Consent and recording permission\n2. Medical history review\n3. Clinical findings presentation (with specific details from radiographs, photos, exams)\n4. Multiple treatment options with detailed explanations\n5. Patient questions and your answers\n6. Risks, benefits, and alternatives\n7. Patient's decision\n\nEXAMPLE OF GOOD WRITING:\n\"Dr - the dark tissue above the implant shows when you smile and the spacing in between your teeth isn't the same\nDr - the midline is a little to one side\nPt - oh\nDr - we can make that look more ideal by adding more teeth\nPt - ok\nDr - all in all your teeth and gums look healthy\nDr - the tissue around your implant isn't that stable but the implant looks good\"\n\nEXAMPLE OF BAD WRITING:\n\"Treatment options discussed including implants and crowns. Patient asked questions. Risks and benefits explained. Patient agreed to proceed.\"\n\nBe extremely specific about:\n- Clinical findings (tooth numbers, measurements, radiographic findings)\n- Each treatment option with pros/cons\n- Cost discussions\n- Timeline discussions\n- Material choices (bonding vs veneers vs crowns)\n- Patient's concerns about aesthetics, function, cost\n- Your recommendations and reasoning",
